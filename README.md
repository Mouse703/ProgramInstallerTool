# Program Installer Tool
A user-friendly interface with checkbox-based program selection and confirmation dialogs for installation of programs after an OS reset.

The project aims to create a Windows Forms application using C# in Visual Studio Enterprise. The application allows users to select from a list of software programs and install them via PowerShell scripts. Users can choose individual programs or select a predefined list to install. The application provides a user-friendly interface with checkboxes for program selection and confirmation dialogs before installation. Additionally, the application includes functionality to delete temporary files after installation completion.

Feel free to customize the program in Visual Studio Enterprise to simplify future OS resets. 

PowerShell scripts are executed in the foreground, allowing users to monitor the installation progress closely.

Required software:
Microsoft Windows Desktop Runtime 8 or above
